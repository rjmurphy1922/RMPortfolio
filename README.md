# RMPortfolio

RMPortfolio is a web portfolio created to display a variety of different projects that I will continue to create. This project will continue to be expanded on over the next several months.

<h2>Langues<h2>
<p>The languages used in the initial launch of this project are HTML and CSS. Flexbox was specifically used for the styling and will continue to be developed upon as I have more time to come back for this project. Specifically media queries will be introduced to give more control over the site with window resizing.</p>
  
<h2>Launch</h2>
<p>The project was launched on 10.27.2020 and will continue to see commits as I have more time to come back and improve on the design and functionality of the project.</p>
